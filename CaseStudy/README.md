•	Flash sensor: To decide auto flash

•	Metering sensor: To decide exposure time

•	Actuators : To film roll, shutter for film exposure, mirror in front of shutter for lifting

•	Motors: For lens focus and Aperture size control

•	Range sensor: For auto focus

•	Main Microcontroller and Lens Microcontroller: 	Together coordinate and senses the light, range and darkness and evaluates the exact position of lenses for zoom ,focus ,aperture opening and required exposure time

•	External Display : for audience to view images

•	View finder: For photographer to view images


Requirements:

HLR-1	To automate the process of zooming 

HLR-2	To automate the process of Focus

HLR-3	To automate the process of Aperture

HLR-4	To automate the process of Exposure time


LLR1 HLR1	By evaluating lens distance

LLR2 HLR2	By using Range sensor and by evaluating the lens position 

LLR3 HLR3	By evaluating the sensors 

LLR4 HLR4	By using Exposure sensor
