APPLICATIONS:


##
1) Room heaters are used to heat a small space and are normally portable or fitted to a wall. Most room heaters use gas or electricity.

##
2) Room heaters are convenient appliances that provide focused and localised heat which is particularly suitable in a room for people that are elderly, ill or with limited mobility.

##
3) Gas heaters are different to electric heaters in their efficiency, as not all the gas is converted into heat output into the room (some is lost as exhaust gases, moisture and the creation of light).
